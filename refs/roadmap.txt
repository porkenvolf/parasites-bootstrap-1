STAGE 1 - PLANNING

STAGE 2 - DEVELOPMENT
Lotsa stuff to do! Assets to draw, an amazing parallax animation as well, this website, the assambly of parasites and metadata, the candy machine implementation, testing and more testing. We better hurry up.

STAGE 3 - MINTING
The mint day will NOT be announced. The mint price is yet to be determined, but the intention is to have a fair price that isn't a barrier to entry, while at the same time allowing us to percieve some monetary retribution and help us to keep making artsy stuff.

STAGE 4 - CHARITY
While our parasites will only mess with it's host in a fictional world of art, in the real world people deal with worse nightmares every day. More than 10% of global population suffer from mental health disorders. To help this cause we will be donating X% the earnings to the research and development of mental treatments.
Making art is something special by itself. Making it for a cause is much more meaningful.




STAGE 5 - THE UNKNOWN
We will most certainly work again under the OAP alias to make more fun stuff, and holders of OAP NFT's will have VIP access to the scoop.
